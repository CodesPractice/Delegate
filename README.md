# Delegates in C#
This repository contains practical examples demonstrating the use of delegates in C#.NET. It is helpful for anyone who wants to understand how delegates work, with easy-to-follow code.

📁 What's Inside

✅ Basic Delegates
Learn how to define and use basic delegates to point to methods and execute them dynamically.

✅ Anonymous Delegates
Shows how to declare and use anonymous delegates directly without creating named methods.

✅ Composable Delegates (Multicast Delegates)
Demonstrates how to combine multiple methods into one delegate and execute them all in order.

✅ Challenge Solution
A small real-world simulation where shipping charges are calculated based on different zones using delegates.

📌 How to Use

Open the solution in Visual Studio or VSCode, then run the Program.cs file. You can toggle between different examples (BasicDelegate(), AnonymousDelegate(), ComposableDelegate(), or Challenge()) by commenting/uncommenting the method calls inside Main().
